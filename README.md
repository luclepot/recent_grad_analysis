## Recent Grad Analysis

This repository and all work in it (just one file, really) is my (Luc Le Pottier's) application to the Center for Academic Innovation's data science fellowship. All of the work is mine alone.

All work is contained within the `analysis.ipynb` file, which *should* render automatically on github. If this is broken (as it often is on github), you can also see the resultant visualizations, saved as `.png` files in the `plots` folder.

Either way, it's best to clone the repository and run the `analysis.ipynb` file in a JupyterNotebook Python3 environment and follow the walk-through in that file.
